# Python and Gophers

Simple introduction to calling go from python, given at the Gopher Helsinki
Meetup on 6.2.2020

For the live presentation I used
[reveal-go](https://github.com/yusukebe/revealgo) and the PDF version was
generated with [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), in both cases
with the `moon` theme.

Make sure to look at the resources, specially the first two, as they show more
code. Also, I recommend [pybindgen](https://pythonhosted.org/PyBindGen/) to
generate the bindings, as shown on the examples.

Nice benchmarking was done with
[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine).

All the images were created with online meme generators, so I don't think they
have authorship or, if they do, I hope they fall within fair usage but, if not,
let me know and I'll remove them as requested.
